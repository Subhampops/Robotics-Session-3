## What is Computer?
A computer is a programmable electronic device that can store, retrieve, and process data. It makes our life easier. 
They are available in various sizes and shapes.
We generally use **Laptops** and **Tower Top Computers** in our day to day lives.

The acronym for the word **COMPUTER** is:

**C** - Commonly <br> 
**O** - Operated <br>
**M** - Machine <br> 
**P** - Particularly <br>
**U** - Used for <br>
**T** - Technology <br>
**E** - Education & <br>
**R** - Research <br>

## Parts of Computer

There are 3 parts of a Computer:

1. **Hardware**: A simple definition of computer hardware is any physical parts or components that contribute to a computer system. It refers to the parts which we can touch and feel. Eg: Monitor, CPU, Hard Disk, Keyboard, etc.
2. **Software**: Software is a set of instructions, programs, and data that control how a computer operates and performs tasks. It refers to the parts which we can not touch and feel. Eg: VS Code, MS.Powerpoint, Scratch, Unreal Engine, etc.
3. **Firmware**: Firmware is a form of microcode or program embedded into hardware devices to help them operate effectively. It exist both as a hardware as a software. Eg: BIOS (Basic Input Output System)

## Generation of Computer
Computers have gone through several distinct generations, each marked by a significant technological advancement. The five generations of computers with examples are:

### **First Generation (1940-1956): Vacuum Tubes**

- **Technology**: Used vacuum tubes for circuitry and magnetic drums for memory. They were large, expensive, and consumed a lot of power.
- **Characteristics**: 
  - Huge size
  - High power consumption
  - Very limited processing speed
  - Programming was done using machine language (binary).
- **Examples**: 
  - **ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer)**: The first general-purpose computer.The ENIAC was composed of 40 panels and contained 17,468 vacuum tubes, 7,200 crystal diodes, 1,500 relays, 70,000 resistors, 10,000 capacitors and around 5 million hand-soldered joints. It weighed more than 27 tons, took up 1800 square feet, and consumed 150 kW of power.

  - **UNIVAC (Universal Automatic Computer)**: The first commercial computer produced in the U.S.

### **Second Generation (1956-1963): Transistors**

- **Technology**: Replaced vacuum tubes with transistors, which were smaller, faster, cheaper, and more energy-efficient.
- **Characteristics**:
  - Smaller in size compared to first-generation computers
  - Reduced power consumption and heat generation
  - Used assembly language and some early high-level programming languages (like FORTRAN and COBOL).
- **Examples**: 
  - **IBM 7090**: A scientific computing machine.
  - **CDC 1604**: Developed by Control Data Corporation, one of the fastest computers of its time.

### **Third Generation (1964-1971): Integrated Circuits (ICs)**

- **Technology**: Used integrated circuits (ICs), which allowed many transistors to be placed on a single silicon chip.
- **Characteristics**:
  - More powerful and reliable than previous generations
  - Smaller size and lower cost
  - Introduction of operating systems and multiprocessing
  - Greater use of high-level languages.
- **Examples**: 
  - **IBM System/360**: A highly successful mainframe computer family.
  - **PDP-8**: A popular minicomputer by Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC).

### **Fourth Generation (1971-Present): Microprocessors**

- **Technology**: Microprocessors, which combine all the CPU functions onto a single chip, are the hallmark of this generation.
- **Characteristics**:
  - Much smaller and faster than previous generations
  - Personal computers (PCs) became widespread
  - Introduction of graphical user interfaces (GUIs), the internet, and high-level programming languages (like C and C++).
- **Examples**:
  - **Intel 4004**: The first microprocessor, marking the start of this generation.
  - **Apple II**: One of the earliest and most successful personal computers.
  - **IBM PC**: The first personal computer by IBM.

### **Fifth Generation (Present and Beyond): Artificial Intelligence (AI)**

- **Technology**: Based on artificial intelligence (AI), including technologies like machine learning, deep learning, quantum computing, and natural language processing.
- **Characteristics**:
  - Computers can now understand natural language and recognize speech and patterns
  - Focus on automation and intelligent decision-making
  - Examples of AI systems that learn and adapt over time
  - Emerging technologies like quantum computing and neuromorphic chips.
- **Examples**:
  - **IBM Watson**: A supercomputer capable of answering questions posed in natural language.
  - **Google's AlphaGo**: An AI that defeated human champions in the game of Go.
  - **Quantum computers (like those from D-Wave or IBM)**: Still in development but represent the next leap forward in computing power.

Each generation represents a leap in computing power, size reduction, and the ability to process and solve more complex tasks efficiently.
