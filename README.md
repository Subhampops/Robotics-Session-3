There are 3 parts of a Computer:

1. **Hardware**: A simple definition of computer hardware is any physical parts or components that contribute to a computer system. It refers to the parts which we can touch and feel. Eg: Monitor, CPU, Hard Disk, Keyboard, etc.
2. **Software**: Software is a set of instructions, programs, and data that control how a computer operates and performs tasks. It refers to the parts which we can not touch and feel. Eg: VS Code, MS.Powerpoint, Scratch, Unreal Engine, etc.
3. **Firmware**: Firmware is a form of microcode or program embedded into hardware devices to help them operate effectively. It exist both as a hardware as a software. Eg: BIOS (Basic Input Output System)

## Generation of Computer
Computers have gone through several distinct generations, each marked by a significant technological advancement. The five generations of computers with examples are:

## Hardware and types of Hardware.
**Computer hardware** refers to the physical components of a computer system that you can see and touch. It encompasses all the devices and elements that are essential for a computer to function. Hardware works in tandem with software, which is a set of instructions or programs that tell the hardware what to do.

### **Types of Computer Hardware**

   Input devices allow users to interact with the computer by providing data or instructions. Common types include:
   - **Keyboard**: For typing data and commands.
   - **Mouse**: Used for pointing, clicking, and navigating graphical interfaces.
   - **Scanner**: Converts physical documents into digital format.
   - **Microphone**: Captures audio input.
   - **Webcam**: Captures video input.
   - **Touchscreen**: Allows direct interaction with the screen using fingers.

#### 2. **Output Devices**
   Output devices display or present data from the computer to the user.
   - **Monitor**: Displays the visual output (text, images, video).
   - **Printer**: Produces physical copies of digital documents and images.
   - **Speakers**: Output sound from the computer.
   - **Projector**: Projects visual output onto a large screen.

   
#### 3. **Processing Devices**
   These are the devices that process and execute instructions, acting as the "brain" of the computer.
   - **Central Processing Unit (CPU)**: The primary processing unit that carries out instructions of computer programs.
   - **Graphics Processing Unit (GPU)**: Specialized for rendering graphics and handling visual computations.
   - **Sound Processing Unit (SPU)**: A Sound Processing Unit (SPU) is a dedicated processor used to handle and manage audio-related tasks in a computer or gaming system. It is designed to offload the computational work associated with audio processing from the main CPU, allowing the system to generate and manipulate sound more efficiently.

#### 4. **Storage Devices**
**Storage devices** are hardware components used to store and retrieve data on a computer. They can be classified into two main categories: **primary memory** and **secondary memory**. Both play vital roles in the functioning of a computer, but they differ in terms of speed, volatility, and capacity.

### **a. Primary Memory**
Primary memory (or **main memory**) refers to the memory that is directly accessible by the **Central Processing Unit (CPU)**. It is faster than secondary memory but generally has a smaller storage capacity and is volatile, meaning it loses its data when the power is turned off.

#### Types of Primary Memory:
   - **RAM (Random Access Memory)**: 
     - **Function**: Temporarily stores data that is actively being used by the CPU for quick access. This includes running applications, system processes, and data in use.
     - **Characteristics**: 
       - **Volatile**: Data is lost when the computer is powered off.
       - **Fast access**: Allows for quick read/write operations.
       - **Limited capacity**: Ranges from a few gigabytes to tens of gigabytes in modern computers.
     - **Example**: A computer with 16GB of RAM.

   - **Cache Memory**:
     - **Function**: A small, high-speed memory located inside or close to the CPU, which stores frequently accessed data and instructions to reduce the time it takes to retrieve them.
     - **Characteristics**:
       - Even faster than RAM.
       - Limited in size (typically measured in megabytes).
       - Used to speed up CPU operations by storing copies of frequently used data.
     - **Example**: L1, L2, and L3 caches found in modern processors.

   - **ROM (Read-Only Memory)**:
     - **Function**: Non-volatile memory that permanently stores essential data, like the computer's boot-up instructions or firmware.
     - **Characteristics**:
       - **Non-volatile**: Data is retained even when the power is off.
       - Data can only be read, not written to (in most cases).
     - **Example**: The BIOS/UEFI firmware that helps initialize the system when a computer is turned on.

### **b. Secondary Memory**
Secondary memory (or **external memory**) refers to storage devices that hold data on a long-term basis. Unlike primary memory, secondary memory is non-volatile, meaning it retains data even when the computer is powered off. Secondary memory typically has much larger storage capacities but slower access speeds compared to primary memory.

#### Types of Secondary Memory:
   - **Hard Disk Drive (HDD)**:
     - **Function**: The most common type of secondary storage device, used for long-term storage of files, applications, and the operating system.
     - **Characteristics**:
       - **Non-volatile**: Data remains even when power is turned off.
       - Uses mechanical parts (spinning platters and a read/write head).
       - **High capacity**: Commonly in the range of 1TB to 4TB or more.
       - **Slower** than solid-state drives but more cost-effective for large storage.
     - **Example**: A 2TB internal HDD used for storing movies, documents, and applications.

   - **Solid State Drive (SSD)**:
     - **Function**: A faster, more reliable alternative to HDDs, used for long-term storage.
     - **Characteristics**:
       - **Non-volatile**.
       - No moving parts, making it faster and more durable than an HDD.
       - **Faster read/write speeds** compared to HDDs.
       - Smaller storage capacities compared to HDDs (typically 256GB to 2TB).
     - **Example**: A 512GB SSD used for faster boot times and quicker access to files and applications.

   - **Optical Discs (CD/DVD/Blu-ray)**:
     - **Function**: Storage media used for storing data, audio, or video files. Mostly used for distribution of software, movies, and music.
     - **Characteristics**:
       - **Non-volatile**.
       - Lower storage capacities (CDs up to 700MB, DVDs up to 4.7GB, Blu-ray discs up to 25GB).
       - Slower read/write speeds compared to SSDs and HDDs.
     - **Example**: A DVD with 4.7GB storage used for storing a movie.

   - **USB Flash Drives**:
     - **Function**: Portable secondary storage devices used for data transfer and temporary storage.

       - Capacity ranges from 16GB to 1TB.
     - **Example**: A 128GB microSD card used in a smartphone for storing photos and apps.

   - **External Hard Drives**:
     - **Function**: Portable storage devices that can be connected to a computer externally via USB or other interfaces.
     - **Characteristics**:
       - **Non-volatile**.
       - Offers large storage capacities (from 500GB to several terabytes).
       - Often used for backups or additional storage for a computer.
     - **Example**: A 2TB external hard drive used for storing backups of files and system data.

   Networking devices allow computers to connect to networks and communicate with other devices.
   - **Network Interface Card (NIC)**: Provides the computer with the ability to connect to a network, either via wired Ethernet or wireless Wi-Fi.
   - **Modem**: Converts digital data into analog signals for transmission over telephone lines.
   - **Router**: Directs data traffic between networks, typically allowing multiple devices to share an internet connection.

These hardware components work together to make the computer functional, enabling it to take input, process it, store information, and produce output.
